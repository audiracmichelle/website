* *Goal* 
   - Predict which borrowers will make late payments using their credit history

* *Activities*
   - Wrangled a very messy transaction stream
   - Recognized and extracted relevant information required for feature engineering and visualization
   - Made the selection of Machine Learning models by assessing their perfomance metrics 
   - Created Docker containers for the Data Engineering team
   - Included exponential decay to features, improving dramatically the precision of the predictions

* *Toolbox*
   - Docker
   - Python

* *Outcome*
   - Delivered a model that achieved 80% precision (99% accuracy)
   - Coded appropriate solutions fit for production
