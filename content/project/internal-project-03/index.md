It is clear that lockdown has mitigated the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus, but there is uncertainty by how much. During the first wave of Covid-19 there was an immediate need for models to determine the potential extent of the spread with stay at home orders in place. 

Now that we are leaving the first peak behind us, the priority of policy makers and modelers in the US has shifted towards quantifying the effect of lifting restrictions to maintain the epidemic's second wave under control.

Understanding the anatomy of mobility in each US county and measuring the causal effect of lockdown and other interventions on Covid-19 spread is key in guiding quick responses and identifying their risk while reopening the economy during this pandemic and others that might come.

This work is in process. Additional parameter tuning and backcasting needs to be done. A second version that incorporates new covariates is underway.

## Goal
   - Understand the impact of stay at home orders to generate risk assessments during the relaxation of restrictions.

## Findings
   - With lockdown in place at least since end of March, the interventions across all states have averted 20,000 deaths after 25 days of being imposed, and 200,000 deaths after 35 days of being imposed.
   - (Once mobility and population density covariates are considered, include findings)
